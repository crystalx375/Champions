## Ranks

- Every mob spawn is assigned a rank. While most are common, some become сhampions, identifiable by colored particles and a special health bar.

- Progression: Higher ranks are rarer but offer better stats, more abilities, and superior loot.

- Customization: using champions_common and champions_client, you can edit spawn chances, colors.
  
## Affixes

- Affixes are unique abilities or attributes that spawn with champion mobs. Players can see which affixes are attached to any champion. These can be identified from a fair distance away, allowing players to sufficiently analyze each champion's threat level and available abilities.

- Affixes, like ranks, can also be configured through the use of the champions_affixes file. Here, players can disable certain affixes.

### Current available affixes:

**Adaptable** - Champion will take less and less damage from the same consecutive damage type  
**Arctic** - Continuously fires homing projectiles that will slow anyone they hit  
**Dampening** - Reduces the damage of indirect attacks

**Infested** - Attacking and being attacked will spawn silverfish that will attack its target  
**Knocking** - Increased knockback from attacks, which will also slow targets for a small period of time  
**Lively** - Regenerates 1 health per second. This increases to 5 health per second when not attacking or pursuing any targets  
**Molten** - Continuously fires homing projectiles that will damage and burn anyone they hit and grants fire resistance  
**Magnetic** - Periodically pulls targets towards itself  
**Paralyzing** - Small chance per attack to "jail" targets, making them unable to move positions for a few seconds  
**Blinded** - You have a chance to be Blinded for couple of seconds when a champion attacks you and hits you  
**Plagued** - Infects nearby creatures with a Poison effect  
**Reflective** - A small portion of damage is reflected back at the attacker
